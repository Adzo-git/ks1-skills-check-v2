/* ---------- Maths Tips (Version 1.4) ----------
   A qualified-teacher-style tip shown below every question — never a hint,
   never tied to the specific numbers, shape, or picture on screen. Each tip
   has a TYPE (matching the wider PTO style used across lessons/worksheets)
   so the label and icon reflect the kind of guidance being given:
     mathsTip      💡 Maths Tip       — practical mathematical strategies
     remember      🧠 Remember        — key knowledge to hold in mind
     topTip        ⭐ Top Tip         — helpful problem-solving approaches
     lookCarefully 👀 Look Carefully  — careful observation
     learningHabit 🌱 Learning Habit  — confidence, resilience, growth mindset
   One tip is picked at random per question from general + strand pools
   (never the same one twice in a row where the pool allows it). None
   reference a number, picture, or method for a specific question — checked
   automatically, see validation. */
