/* ============================================================
   PTO KS1 MATHS SKILLS CHECK — QUESTION BANK  (Version 1.1)
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Plain data. Loaded directly by the website (no build step).
   360 questions across the full KS1 Maths curriculum.

   Each assessment randomly selects 30 questions with balanced
   curriculum coverage (see app.js -> selectAssessment).

   To EDIT a question: find it below and change the text/options.
   To ADD questions in bulk: use tools/generate-questions.js and
   re-run it with Node (optional — not needed to run the site).
