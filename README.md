# KS1 Maths Skills Check (Version 1.9)

A short, friendly Key Stage 1 maths check for **Primary Tutor Online**. A parent
sets it up, the child answers **37 questions** one screen at a time, and the parent
gets a simple **strengths and next-steps report**. Results are saved to Supabase.

The 37 questions are chosen at random from a bank of **360 curriculum-mapped
questions** with balanced coverage of every KS1 maths strand, so repeat sittings
feel fresh while staying fair and representative.

Built to the PTO Standards: curriculum-led, child-first, calm, and honest.
Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no build step, no framework, minimal maintenance.

## What's in the box

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `index.html` | The whole app (all screens) |
| `styles.css` | PTO design system (purple/white/pink, Poppins, calm, accessible) |
| `questions.js` | The 360-question bank + strand definitions — **edit this to change questions** |
| `app.js` | Flow, question selection, rendering, report generation, saving |
| `config.js` | **The one file you edit to go live** (Supabase details) |
| `supabase-setup.sql` | Run once in Supabase to create the results table |
| `tools/generate-questions.js` | *Optional.* The offline authoring script used to build `questions.js` in bulk. **Not part of the website** — only needed (with Node) if you want to regenerate the bank. |
| `README.md` | This file |

---

## Try it first (no setup needed)

1. Open `config.js` and leave `SAVE_RESULTS: true` but keep the placeholder keys,
   **or** set `SAVE_RESULTS: false`.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Walk through the whole check. You'll see the full report; it just won't be saved
   (a small note says "Preview mode"). This is the quickest way to review the
   questions and report before going live.

---

## Going live — two short jobs

### 1. Set up Supabase (stores the results)

1. Create a free account at **https://supabase.com** and make a new project.
2. Open **SQL Editor → New query**, paste the contents of `supabase-setup.sql`,
   and click **Run**. This creates the `skills_check_sessions` table and locks it
   down so the public site can only *add* results, never read them.
3. Open **Project Settings → API** and copy two values:
   - **Project URL**
   - **anon public** key
4. Paste both into `config.js`. (The anon key is designed to be public — it's safe
   in a website because Row Level Security only allows inserts.)

You'll read the collected results in Supabase under **Table Editor →
skills_check_sessions**.

### 2. Publish with GitHub Pages (hosts the site, free)

1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload all the files in this folder
   (keep them at the top level, so `index.html` is in the root).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**,
   choose your branch (usually `main`) and folder `/root`, then **Save**.
4. Wait a minute, then visit the URL GitHub gives you
   (`https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/`).

That's it. To update anything later, edit the file and push the change.

---

## Testing with real families (the point of V1)

Before wider release, test with a small group (the PTO Standards suggest a mix of
home-educated, mainstream and SEND learners across different ages). Ask them:

- Did your child understand what to do without help?
- Was anything confusing, too easy, or too hard?
- Did the report make sense and feel useful?
- Did it feel calm and encouraging?

Each completed check appears as one row in Supabase, including the answer chosen for
every question — enough to spot any weak questions before you expand the bank.

---

## Key decisions (and why)

These follow "choose the simplest solution that satisfies the educational
requirements":

- **37 questions from a 360-question bank.** Originally 30, increased after the first
  educational review found that Position & Direction and Statistics (1 question each)
  gave too little evidence to fairly classify a whole strand. Quotas are now Number &
  Place Value 8, Addition & Subtraction 6, Measurement 5, Multiplication & Division 4,
  Fractions 4, Geometry 4, Position & Direction 3, Statistics 3 — totalling 37, still a
  few minutes longer at most. Every strand now has at least 3 questions. Within each
  strand the app picks *different skills* and a random variant of each, so no child
  gets two questions on the exact same skill (bank checked: every strand has more
  distinct skills than its quota) and repeat sittings differ.
- **Gentle difficulty ramp.** After selection, questions are ordered easier-first
  with a little randomness inside each difficulty band, so children start with a
  confidence-builder (Part 20).
- **Metadata: curriculum year, misconception category, estimated time.** Each
  question also carries `curriculumYear` (Year 1 or Year 2, taken from the actual
  DfE National Curriculum programme of study for each strand — not invented),
  `misconceptionCategory` (one of 13 short tags, e.g. `place-value`,
  `fraction-partitioning`, `time-reading`, used for diagnostic grouping) and
  `estimatedSeconds` (a simple difficulty-based estimate, not tuned per question).
  These ride inside the existing `responses` jsonb column when a result is saved —
  **no database schema change was needed.**
- **Two short context questions, not shown in the printed report.** After the
  last maths question the child rates how the check felt (easy / OK / quite
  difficult / very difficult); after the handover the parent rates how
  independently their child worked (completely / a little help / a lot of help).
  Both are stored with the result (`child_confidence`, `parent_independence`) for
  interpreting the score, but are deliberately **not shown on the printed report**
  — the report stays exactly as designed, and this keeps the child-facing question
  simple and un-leading.
- **Assessment duration is measured precisely.** `duration_seconds` covers only
  the 30 maths questions (first question shown to last one answered) — it
  deliberately excludes the two short survey screens, so it reflects genuine
  time-on-task.
- **One results table, JSON detail.** Every per-question answer is stored inside the
  session row (`responses`), so nothing is lost and analytics is possible later —
  without the complexity of extra tables for V1. Each row also records `percentage`,
  a friendly `reference` (e.g. `PTO-2026-000123`), `assessment_name`,
  `assessment_version` (the question-set version) and `status`, so different checks
  and question versions stay distinguishable.
- **Insert-only security.** The public site can add results but not read them,
  which protects the emails you collect.
- **No back button.** The Standards (Part 20) prefer capturing current thinking over
  improved guessing, so children move forward through the check.
- **Report leads with strengths**, uses gentle language, groups by curriculum strand,
  gives a practical "try at home" tip per area, and is honest that a short check is an
  early snapshot (Part 14).
- **Area wording is deliberately non-absolute.** "Developing" strands read as "an
  area worth exploring further together"; "practice" strands read as "additional
  practice is likely to help build confidence" — never a flat "needs practice."
  Any strand answered with 3 or fewer questions also gets an explicit caveat that
  it's "an early signal to explore rather than a firm conclusion," since a strand
  sampled by only a few questions genuinely doesn't support a strong claim.
- **Option order is shuffled** per child so the answer isn't always in the same place.
- **Child's first name** is collected (in addition to the required parent name/email)
  purely to personalise the report, as the Standards ask.

## Deliberately NOT in Version 1 (future work, once V1 is tested)

Kept out to protect simplicity and reliability, as instructed. (Statistics and
Position & Direction are now **included** in v1.0-rc1 — all eight KS1 strands are
covered.)

- Resume-after-refresh / autosave mid-check. The check is short; adding this brings
  edge cases and maintenance. Worth revisiting if testing shows a need.
- Automatic emailing of the report (parents can save/print it for now).
- Adaptive difficulty, dashboards, logins, lesson recommendations, other
  subjects/key stages.

---

## Changing the questions

**Small edits:** open `questions.js` and change the wording or options of any
question directly — each is a plain object with the PTO metadata (ID, skill ID,
strand, difficulty, type, misconception, explanation).

**Bulk changes:** use the optional `tools/generate-questions.js` script with Node
(`node tools/generate-questions.js questions.js`) to regenerate the whole bank from
templates. This is only an authoring convenience — the website itself never runs it.

**Curriculum balance** is set by `STRAND_QUOTA` near the top of the selection logic
in `app.js` (it must total `ASSESSMENT_LENGTH`, currently 37). **Illustrations** use
the built-in types: `dots`, `array`, `coins`, `shape` (circle, square, rectangle,
triangle, pentagon, hexagon), `clock` (o'clock and half past), `fraction` (bar,
tall-column, or pie/pizza), `bars`, `pictogram`, `tally`, `base10` (Dienes-style
tens rods and ones cubes), `numberline`, `turns` (a quarter-turn reference circle)
and `arrow` (a single directional arrow).

## Illustrations (Version 1.1)

194 of the 360 questions (54%) now carry an illustration, up from 103 (29%) in
v1.0. Every addition follows one rule: **if a picture doesn't genuinely aid
understanding of that specific question, it doesn't get one.** A few examples of
questions left as text on purpose: comparing "a car" and "a shoe" by weight (crude
SVG icons of a car and a shoe would look like decoration, not a real comparison);
matching an object's name to a shape category (`GEO-REAL2D`/`GEO-3D` — needs real
photos to be honest, not abstract SVG shapes); ordinal-position vocabulary
(`POS-ORD` — the words themselves are the thing being tested).

Two things worth knowing if you're reviewing illustration quality:

- **The number line never labels the answer.** For "what is one more than 5?" the
  line shows ticks and numbers either side, but the tick at the answer position is
  left blank with just a "?" — otherwise the answer would be printed right on the
  page. (Checked against all 23 number-line questions in the bank — zero leaks.)
- **The quarter-turns diagram is a fixed reference, not the answer.** Every
  `POS-TURN` question shows the same "this is what one quarter turn looks like"
  image rather than shading in the number of quarters that happens to be correct
  for that question — otherwise a child could just count shaded segments instead
  of reasoning about turns.

Nothing about the assessment engine, scoring, Supabase schema, quotas, or
assessment length changed to support this — illustrations are purely a `q.illustration`
field read by `renderIllustration()` in `app.js` and never touch the saved
`responses` data.

## Maths Tips (Version 1.4)

Every question shows a small typed tip box below the answer choices — each
tip now has a **type**, matching the wider PTO style used across lessons,
worksheets and the home education book:

| Type | Icon | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Maths Tip | 💡 | Practical mathematical strategies |
| Remember | 🧠 | Key knowledge to hold in mind |
| Top Tip | ⭐ | Helpful problem-solving approaches |
| Look Carefully | 👀 | Careful observation |
| Learning Habit | 🌱 | Confidence, resilience, growth mindset |

One tip is picked at random per question from a bank of **185 distinct
tips** (`TIPS` near the top of `app.js`, each with `category`, `type`, and
`text`) — 25 general tips (all `learningHabit`) plus 20 per curriculum
strand, typed individually by what each one actually teaches (fact →
`remember`, strategy → `mathsTip`, approach → `topTip`, observation →
`lookCarefully`). Selection avoids an immediate repeat where the pool
allows it. A simulated 37-question sitting showed 4–5 of the 5 types
appearing per sitting with zero immediate repeats; across 500 simulated
sittings (18,500 question-to-question transitions) the immediate-repeat
rate was 0%.

Every tip was checked to contain no numbers and no reference to any
specific question, shape, or picture — this was verified automatically
(zero tips contain a digit) and by checking a full sitting's tips against
that question's correct answer text (zero matches).

This is purely a content and presentation change: it reads `q.strand`,
picks a tip object, and writes its icon/label/text into three existing
elements (`#tip-icon`, `#tip-label`, `#tip-text`). The visual design
(box, colours, spacing) is unchanged from v1.2 — only the label/icon are
now dynamic instead of fixed to "💡 Maths Tip". Nothing in the assessment
engine, scoring, question selection, reporting, illustrations, or Supabase
was touched.

## PTO Assessment Design System (Version 1.5)

This release begins establishing a shared visual identity across future PTO
assessments — see **`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`** for the full specification (strand
colours, KS1–KS4 progressive philosophy, illustration/tip/encouragement
principles). What actually shipped in the live assessment this round:

1. **Strand colour accent.** The Maths Tip box now shows a thin left-edge
   stripe in the current question's strand colour (8 colours, one per
   strand — see `STRAND_COLORS` in `app.js`). Colour is always paired with
   the tip's icon and text, never the only signal.
2. **Sparing encouragement.** A small rotating message ("Keep going.",
   "Nearly there.", etc.) appears every 6th question — never on every
   screen, and never on the final question. Verified: exactly 6 of 37
   questions in a simulated sitting.
3. **Emoji-capable illustrations, proven on two real questions.** The dot
   illustration renderer now accepts an optional emoji glyph, and a new
   `emojigroups` type shows two named groups side by side. Applied to the
   "red apples and green apples" addition question (🍎🍏) and the "cakes
   eaten" subtraction question (🍰) — the two questions in the bank where
   the emoji genuinely matches the question's own wording.

**A real bug caught during this work:** the first version of the
`emojigroups` illustration set its `aria-label` to the total number of
objects shown — which, for a "how many altogether?" question, is the
correct answer. A screen reader would have spoken the answer aloud. Fixed
to describe the groups by their given counts instead (already stated in
the question text) and never the combined total; verified against all 5
`emojigroups` questions in the bank with zero leaks.

**Deliberately not done this round** (see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` for the
reasoning on each): a full sweep replacing every dot illustration with
themed emoji across all 360 questions (needs a content-matching review per
question, not a mechanical change); illustrated character companions (no
character artwork exists — faking it with primitives would look exactly
like the "clip-art, mismatched styles" this system explicitly rejects); a
deeper pass sharpening the ~185 Maths Tips to be more concept-specific
per strand; KS2–KS4 or other-subject assessments (don't exist as products).

## Illustration concreteness pass (Version 1.6)

Reviewed the full 360-question bank against one rule: **concrete objects for
real-world contexts, mathematical models for mathematical concepts.**

**Finding:** almost none of the bank actually needed changing. Systematically
checked every question's text for named real-world objects (cars, buses,
apples, cakes, pencils, books, flowers) — only 2 existed (already fixed in
v1.5: 🍎🍏 and 🍰). Every other illustrated question either says "counters" (a
legitimate KS1 maths manipulative, correctly left as a mathematical model —
not a decoration problem) or names no object at all (abstract number
questions like "double 5"). Fractions, geometry, arrays, and statistics were
already using the appropriate mathematical models (bars/pies, shapes,
arrays, pictograms) and were left untouched.

**The one real change:** `NPV-COUNT` ("How many counters can you see?" ×10)
was the single closest match to the brief's own worked example (cars) — a
foundational counting skill shown as plain purple dots. It now rotates
through real KS1-friendly objects with matching emoji (toy cars 🚗, buses 🚌,
apples 🍎, pencils ✏️, books 📚, flowers 🌸, footballs ⚽, sweets 🍬).

**A real, pre-existing accessibility bug found and fixed during the review:**
a systematic sweep of every illustrated question's `aria-label` against its
correct answer (word-boundary matching, not naive substring, to avoid false
positives) found that all 10 `NPV-COUNT` questions had an aria-label stating
the exact dot count — which **is** the correct answer for "how many can you
see?" A screen-reader user would have heard the answer spoken aloud. This
predates this session; the systematic check required by this task is what
caught it. Also found: `NPV-TENS`'s base-10 block illustration stated "`{n}`
tens and `{n}` ones" as its label — safe for `TENMORE`/`TENLESS`/`BUILD`
(restates the *given* number), but a real leak for `NPV-TENS` specifically,
since that question asks "how many tens?" Both fixed with a per-question
`ariaLabel` override (`svgDots`/`svgBase10` now accept one), verified with a
full sweep across all 204 illustrated questions: **zero remaining leaks.**

Only `app.js`, `questions.js`, and `tools/generate-questions.js` changed —
`index.html` and `styles.css` are byte-identical to v1.5. The full regression
suite (37 questions, correct quotas, 2,000 unique selections, encouragement
frequency, report generation, Supabase row shape) passes unchanged.

---

## Crash fix (Version 1.6.1)

**Bug:** `renderQuestion()` crashed on Question 1 with `Cannot set properties
of null (setting 'textContent')`.

**Root cause:** `$(id)` (the app's `document.getElementById` shorthand) had
no guard — if `index.html` didn't have every element `app.js` expected
(e.g. an `index.html` from before v1.4/v1.5 added `tip-box`, `tip-icon`,
`tip-label`, `encourage-text`, paired with a newer `app.js`), `$()` returned
`null` and the very next line (`.textContent = ...`) threw and stopped the
whole assessment.

**Fix:** `$()` now returns a safe no-op placeholder instead of `null` when
an element is missing, and logs a clear console warning
(`[PTO] Expected element #… was not found…`) so the gap stays visible to a
developer without breaking the page for a child mid-assessment. This is a
general safeguard — it isn't specific to the tip/encouragement elements
that triggered this particular report, and protects every `$()` call in
the file the same way.

**Verified with three tests, not just a code read:**
1. The current `index.html` + `app.js` together — zero warnings, zero
   errors, from Question 1 through a full 37-question sitting.
2. The exact failure reproduced deliberately (an `index.html` with
   `tip-box`/`tip-icon`/`tip-label`/`encourage-text` removed) against the
   *old* unguarded `$()` — confirmed it would have thrown, matching the
   bug report exactly.
3. The same deliberately-broken HTML against the *new* guarded `$()` — no
   crash, 4 clear warnings logged, assessment continues normally.

If you're seeing this crash, the most likely cause is `index.html` being
out of sync with `app.js` — re-deploying the `index.html` in this delivery
resolves it. The defensive fix in `app.js` means this specific failure mode
can't recur even if a future file gets out of sync again.

---

## Toward the "Version 2.0" vision (v1.7 — a genuine first slice, not the whole thing)

The v2.0 brief asked for every one of 360 questions to be individually
reviewed by "an experienced KS1 teacher, curriculum designer, and children's
illustrator." That's real, valuable, multi-session work — this release is a
**verified first slice** of it, not a claim that the full review is done.
Strand colours were explicitly kept unchanged (already correct, per your
confirmation) — no code change needed there.

**What shipped:**

1. **Pictograms now show real themed icons, not plain purple circles** — a
   genuine bug fix as much as a style improvement (a "pictogram" showing
   dots wasn't actually a pictogram). `Apples`→🍎, `Cats`→🐱, `Buses`→🚌, and
   critically **`Red`/`Blue`/`Green`→🔴🔵🟢**, directly matching the brief's
   own pattern-question example. `Plums` uses a purple circle rather than a
   fabricated "plum emoji" — an honest stand-in, not a claim to photorealism.
2. **Scattered (non-grid) layout for real-object counting questions.** All
   10 `NPV-COUNT` questions now place their objects with a deterministic
   jitter instead of a tidy grid, so children genuinely count rather than
   recognise a row shape — matching "children should genuinely count, not
   recognise a line." Verified mathematically *and* against the actual
   generated SVGs that no two objects can ever overlap (minimum pairwise
   distance 54–58px against a 40px safety threshold).
3. **Light micro-story characters** in the two word-problem questions —
   Emily, Oliver, Sophie, and Ben (a boy/girl mix, as requested) now appear
   as "Emily has 4 red apples..." rather than "There are 4 red apples...".
   Implemented as **text only** — no drawn character art exists, and
   inventing placeholder illustrations would risk exactly the
   inconsistent, clip-art look the Design System explicitly rejects.
4. **Illustrations are larger on desktop**, via a `min-width: 700px` media
   query only — mobile is byte-for-byte unaffected below that width.

**Verified, not asserted:** full aria-label leak sweep across all 204
illustrated questions (0 leaks); scatter-overlap check against the actual
generated coordinates for all 10 real questions (not just the formula in
isolation); a full 37-question sitting rendered with 0 failures; report and
Supabase row shape confirmed unchanged.

**Deliberately not done this round, and why** (see also `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`):

- **Individual review of all 360 questions.** Only the questions with a
  clear, concrete match to the brief (real-object counting, statistics
  pictograms, the two word problems) were changed. The rest — abstract
  number questions, "counters" sharing/halving questions, geometry, arrays,
  fractions, measurement — were already using correct mathematical models
  and weren't mechanically touched, consistent with "do not replace genuine
  mathematical representations."
- **Shapes embedded in real objects** (house, rocket, castle, robot) —
  a real illustration-design task requiring new artwork, not a data change.
- **Drawn character illustrations** — same reason; used as text instead.
- **Pattern questions** (red/blue/green sequences) — these don't currently
  exist in the question bank. The pictogram colour-icon work above is ready
  for them, but adding new pattern *questions* is new content, not an
  illustration pass, so it wasn't added without being asked for explicitly.

**One recommendation for your consideration** (not implemented, per your
instruction to flag rather than change): `Plums` could use a genuine fruit
emoji if you're open to a close-but-imperfect match (e.g. 🍇 grapes) rather
than a purple circle — a small trade-off between visual accuracy and
literal correctness, worth a quick call rather than me guessing.

---

## Continuing toward the illustrated-workbook feel (v1.8)

A further verified slice, same honest scope as v1.7 — not a claim that all
360 questions have now been reviewed.

**What shipped:**

1. **Arrays now show themed objects while keeping the row/column grid
   intact** — `MD-GROUPS` ("How many eggs altogether?") shows 🥚 in rows,
   `MD-ARRAY` ("How many oranges are in this array?") shows 🍊. The
   *structure* (rows × columns) is the genuine mathematical model and is
   completely unchanged — only the dot became a themed icon. Question text
   was updated to match ("dots" → "eggs"/"oranges") so text and picture
   never disagree.
2. **`MEA-MOSTCOIN` ("which is the largest amount of money?") now has an
   illustration** — previously text-only. Shows the actual coins named in
   the answer options (already given as text, so nothing new is revealed).
3. **Small-scene feel via scattered layout**, extended to three more
   contexts: the apple/cake word problems, and money questions
   (`MEA-MONEY`, `MEA-MOSTCOIN`) — coins now sit naturally rather than in a
   straight row, echoing real coins spilled on a table.
4. **10 Maths Tips sharpened** toward the "strategy for this thinking, not
   generic encouragement" style from your own examples — e.g. "The hands
   on a clock tell us different things" → "The short hand points to the
   hour, and the long hand points to the minutes"; "Rows and columns can
   help you count arrays" → "Equal rows can help you see multiplication
   clearly." Bank re-verified: still exactly 185, all unique, zero digits.

**Verified, not asserted:** full aria-label leak sweep across all 209
illustrated questions (0 leaks, including the 5 newly-illustrated
`MEA-MOSTCOIN` questions); every new scattered illustration checked against
its actual generated coordinates; full 37-question sitting with 0 render
failures and 0 missing tips; report and Supabase row shape unchanged.

**Still deliberately not done** (same reasons as v1.7 — see `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
and the note above): full individual review of all 360 questions; shapes
embedded in real-object silhouettes; drawn character illustrations; a full
pass over all 185 tips (10 of the weakest were sharpened this round as a
representative sample, not an exhaustive rewrite).

---

## Continuing the illustration pass (v1.9)

**What shipped:**

1. **The last four "counters" questions are now real objects.** `MD-SHARE`
   ("Share sweets equally between children") uses 🍬, `MD-GROUP` ("groups of
   toy cars") uses 🚗, `FRA-HALFQ` ("half of these stickers") uses ⭐,
   `FRA-QUARTERQ` ("a quarter of these cookies") uses 🍪 — all scattered
   rather than gridded, and all with question text updated to match (no
   question anywhere in the bank still says "counters" — confirmed by a
   full-text search). This closes out the "counters" family that was
   deliberately left alone in v1.7 as a legitimate mathematical manipulative;
   on reflection, sharing sweets between friends or splitting cookies is a
   genuinely more concrete framing for 5–7 year olds than an abstract
   "counter," so these were worth converting.
2. **2 more Maths Tips sharpened** — the array tip and a money tip now tie
   directly to real strategies already used elsewhere in the app (the money
   tip, "add the largest coin first," is the same strategy already given as
   a `teacherNote` on the money-counting question — the tip and the
   question design now reinforce each other).

**Verified, not asserted:** full aria-label leak sweep across all 209
illustrated questions (0 leaks); confirmed zero remaining "counters"
references anywhere in question text; tip bank re-checked (185, unique,
zero digits); full 37-question sitting with 0 render failures, 0 missing
tips; report and Supabase row shape unchanged.

**Remaining scope**, unchanged from v1.8: full individual review of all 360
questions, shapes-in-real-object silhouettes, drawn character illustrations,
and a full pass over the remaining ~173 tips.
